### About Me
I'm a Computer Science student at Brigham Young University with an emphasis in computer security. I've recently participated in research with Dr. Zappala about the usability of hardware security keys, where I helped to develop working prototypes of an account recovery system for hardware security keys. Recently I've been focusing on learning more about reverse engineering. Aside from computer security, I'm also interested in programming languages, software development, music and Chinese. In my free time I enjoy ultimate frisbee and mountain unicycling.

#### Things I've worked on include:
- Modifying OpenSk source code to perform account recovery
- Writing a website to test our account recovery system
- Modifying Chromium source code to be compatible with our system
- Writing a prototype website for team task management
- Writing a server and client for playing chess

I'm currently interested in finding internships that will allow me to work on something meaningful while building out my skillsets, especially those related to computer security. I'm particularly interested in projects involving reverse engineering or development of secure software.

#### Recent Coursework:
- Introduction to Computer Systems
- Computer Security
- Advanced Software Construction
